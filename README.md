# Visual Search

Participants will do visual search for a T among distractor L's and intermediate
shapes, rotated 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees. Search arrays have 6, 12 or 18 items,
and the target T is present in exactly half the trials.

Reaction Time and Performance (correct response or not, given target presence)
are stored, along with array set size.
